### Paper Submission and Templates

Submission is electronic, through the [OpenReview portal for the workshop](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/WASSA) with the deadline for direct submission on May 17, 2024. 

Both long and short papers must be anonymised for double-blind reviewing, must follow the [ACL Author Guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines), and must use the ACL templates available on the [ACL Rolling Review website](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).
The submitting author must have an OpenReview profile. Please ensure profiles are complete at least two weeks before submission. [This tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kJeoAfwbnFapUN0ySLSoOm11-2odz48DGS1DEzNs03k/edit#slide=id.gcfa2063058_0_0) from the ACL Rolling Review might be helpful. 

In addition to standard submissions, submissions which were previously submitted to ARR and reviewed there can be committed to the workshop (together with the reviews) not later than May 24, 2024.
