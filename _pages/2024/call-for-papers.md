## 14th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2024)
### ACL’24, Bangkok, Thailand, 15 August, 2024

## Background and Envisaged Scope
Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis has become a highly developed research area, ranging from binary classification of reviews to the detection of complex emotion structures between entities found in text. This field has expanded both on a practical level, finding numerous successful applications in business, as well as on a theoretical level, allowing researchers to explore more complex research questions related to affective computing. Its continuing importance is also shown by the interest it generates in other disciplines such as Economics, Sociology, Psychology, Marketing, Crisis Management & Digital Humanities.

The aim of WASSA 2024 is to bring together researchers working on Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications to other NLP or real-world tasks (e.g. public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, social media mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. For this edition, we encourage the submission of long and short research and demo papers including, but not restricted to the following topics:

- Resources for subjectivity, sentiment, emotion and social media analysis
- Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, aggregation and summarization
- Humor, Irony and Sarcasm detection
- Mis- and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes
- Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis
- Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl. personality analysis and profiling
- Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis
- Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis
- Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- The role of emotions in argument mining
- Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis
- Multimodal emotion detection and classification
- Applications of sentiment and emotion mining
- Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies.

In the past years we have noticed that WASSA offers a platform to researchers investigating sentiment and emotion in lesser-resourced languages. The 2023 edition featured work on no less than 23 different languages and two papers specifically targeted multilingual emotion detection. We wish to continue these efforts as we find it important to consider and publish advances in any language as this helps to underline the wealth of our research community and to diminish the dominance of English-language research. To this purpose we propose a **Special track on multilinguality and social bridge between high- and lesser-resourced languages/communities**.

### Important dates

* May 17, 2024 – Submission deadline.
* June 17, 2024 – Notification of acceptance
* July 1, 2024 - Camera-ready papers due.
* August 15, 2024 – Workshop.

### Shared tasks

This year two shared tasks are co-located with WASSA:

- A fourth run of the shared task on [Empathy Detection and Emotion Classification](https://workshop-wassa.github.io/2024/shared_task/)
- Another task on Explainability of Cross-lingual Emotion Detection, [EXALT](https://lt3.ugent.be/exalt/)

Please note that both tasks follow a different timeline. 

### Papers

At WASSA 2024, we will accept three types of submissions:

For the regular research track we accept **long** & **short** papers.

Additionally, we accept double submissions and double commitment of ARR reviews in parallel to WASSA and another venue. Please note that you must immediately withdraw your paper from WASSA if you decide to publish it elsewhere. They must be committed to the workshop (together with the reviews) not later than May 24, 2024.

#### Long papers
**Long** papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, with any number of additional pages of references, and will be presented orally.


#### Short papers
**Short** papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, with two (2) additional pages of references, and will be presented either orally or as a poster.


#### Demo papers
Also this year is there is an industry track, for which we accept **demo papers**:

- **Demo papers** describe system demonstrations, ranging from early prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Please note: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate for this track. Demo papers may consist of up to six (6) pages of content, these will be presented as a poster and should include a live demonstration. For more information <a href="https://2024.aclweb.org/calls/system_demonstration/">click here</a>.

Additionally, **system description papers** from the shared tasks will be presented either orally or as poster.

### Submission procedure and templates

Submissions without reviews can be done directly through our [OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/WASSA).

Authors who received reviews already through the ACL Rolling Review process are invited to commit their reviewed paper to WASSA. To do so, please go to our [OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/WASSA) and click on "ACL 2024 Workshop WASSA Commitment Submission". You will then need to add the title, the URL to the ARR submission with reviews + metareview, and other information. The commitment date for ARR papers with reviews is May 24.

Both long and short papers must be anonymised for double-blind reviewing, must follow the [ACL Author Guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines), and must use the ACL templates available on the [ACL Rolling Review website](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).
The submitting author must have an OpenReview profile. Please ensure profiles are complete at least 2 weeks before submission. [This tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kJeoAfwbnFapUN0ySLSoOm11-2odz48DGS1DEzNs03k/edit#slide=id.gcfa2063058_0_0) from the ACL Rolling Review might be helpful.


#### Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data
ARR encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. Supplementary materials may include appendices, software or data. For example, pre processing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into appendices. However, if the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in appendices. Reviewers are not required to consider material in appendices.
Appendices should come after the references in the submitted pdf, but do not count towards the page limit. Software should be submitted as a single .tgz or .zip archive, and data as a separate single .tgz or .zip archive. Supplementary materials must be fully anonymized to preserve the two-way anonymized reviewing policy.
