#### Mind the Gaps and Normal Accidents

NLP is now stable enough to be used in production systems, and will soon become even more pervasive. However, even today's systems are already highly complex and unpredictable. As they become more ubiquitous, different algorithms will interact with each other directly leading to tightly coupled systems whose capacity to cause harm we will be unable to predict.

In his book Normal Accidents, the sociologist Charles Perrow proposed a framework to analyze technologies and their risks according to their complexity and the interdependence of their components. He showed that accidents were nigh on unavoidable due to those two features.

We apply Perrow’s framework to NLP and argue that under the current paradigm, "normal accidents" are built into the system and only a matter of time, and that some issues in current NLP practice that aid this development:
the early adoption of methods without sufficient understanding or analysis;
the preference for computational methods regardless of risks associated with their limitations; the dangers of unexplainable methods.

If these issues are not addressed, we risk a loss of reproducibility, reputability, and subsequently public trust in our field.
Together, these factors can help us better understand the risks of complex NLP systems, and to make our systems safer and more reliable.


#### Bio
Dirk Hovy is an associate professor of Computer Science in the department of marketing at Bocconi University and director of the Data and Marketing Insights research unit at the Bocconi Center for Data Science and Analytics. He did his PhD at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, working as research assistant at the Information Sciences Institute.

His research focuses on computational social science and he is interested in what language can tell us about society, and what computers can tell us about language, as well as ethics in NLP and demographic biases.

#### Beneath the Tip of the Iceberg: Current Challenges and New Directions in Sentiment Analysis Research


Sentiment analysis as a field has come a long way since it was first introduced as a task nearly 20 years ago. It has widespread commercial applications in various domains like marketing, risk management, market research, and politics, to name a few. Given its saturation in specific subtasks -- such as sentiment polarity classification -- and datasets, there is an underlying perception that this field has reached its maturity. In this article, we discuss this perception by pointing out the shortcomings and under-explored, yet key aspects of this field that are necessary to attain true sentiment understanding. We analyze the significant leaps responsible for its current relevance. Further, we attempt to chart a possible course for this field that covers many overlooked and unanswered questions.

Joint work with Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder
