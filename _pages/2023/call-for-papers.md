## 13th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2023)
### ACL’23, Toronto, Canada, 14 July, 2023

## Background and Envisaged Scope
 Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis has become a highly developed research area, ranging from binary classification of reviews to the detection of complex emotion structures between entities found in text. This field has expanded both on a practical level, finding numerous successful applications in business, as well as on a theoretical level, allowing researchers to explore more complex research questions related to affective computing. Its continuing importance is also shown by the interest it generates in other disciplines such as Economics, Sociology, Psychology, Marketing, Crisis Management & Digital Humanities.

The aim of WASSA 2023 is to bring together researchers working on Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications to other NLP or real-world tasks (e.g. public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, social media mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. For this edition, we encourage the submission of long and short research and demo papers including, but not restricted to the following topics:


- Resources for subjectivity, sentiment, emotion and social media analysis
- Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, aggregation and summarization
- Humor, Irony and Sarcasm detection
- Mis- and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes
- Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis
- Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl. personality analysis and profiling
- Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis
- Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis
- Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- The role of emotions in argument mining
- Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis
- Multimodal emotion detection and classification
- Applications of sentiment and emotion mining
- Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies.

We furthermore encourage submissions to the special theme Ethics in Affective Computing, including opinion papers, as well as experimental papers. This includes the following topics, but is not limited to them:

- Which properties of a model render a automatic analysis task unethical?
- Which characteristics of an annotation task are to be considered in ethical considerations?
- What are appropriate methods to analyze data and models from an ethical perspective?
- What aspects are particular important for affective analysis tasks, in contrast to other NLP
settings?


### Important dates

* April 28, 2023– Submission deadline.
* May 1, 2023 – Commitment deadline for submitting through ARR with reviews
* May 23, 2023 – Notification of acceptance.
* June 6, 2023 – Camera-ready papers due.
* June 12, 2023 – Pre-recorded video due.
* July 14, 2023 – Workshop.


Note that the shared tasks follow a different timeline that will be communicated separately.

### Papers


At WASSA 2023, we will accept three types of submissions:
For the regular research track we accept **long** & **short** papers.

Additionally, we accept double submissions and double commitment of ARR reviews in parallel to WASSA and another venue. Please note that you must immediately withdraw your paper from WASSA if you decide to publish it elsewhere. They must be committed to the workshop (together with the reviews) not later than May 1, 2023.

#### Long papers
**Long** papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, with any number of additional pages of references, and will be presented orally.


#### Short papers
**Short** papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, with two (2) additional pages of references, and will be presented either orally or as a poster.


#### Demo papers
New this year is that we also introduce an industry track, for which we accept **demo papers**:

- **Demo papers** describe system demonstrations, ranging from early prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Please note that Please note: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate for this track. Demo papers may consist of up to six (6) pages of content, these will be presented as a poster and should include a live demonstration. For more information <a href="https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/system_demonstration/">click here</a>.

Additionally, system description papers from the shared task will be presented either orally or as poster.


### Submission procedure and templates

Submissions without reviews can be done directly through our [OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2023/Workshop/WASSA).

Authors who received reviews already through the ACL Rolling Review process are invited to commit their reviewed paper to WASSA. To do so, please go to our [OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2023/Workshop/WASSA) and click on "ACL 2023 Workshop WASSA Commitment Submission". You will then need to add the title, the URL to the ARR submission with reviews + metareview, and other information. The commitment date for ARR papers with reviews is May 1.

Both long and short papers must be anonymised for double-blind reviewing, must follow the [ACL Author Guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines), and must use the ACL 2022 templates available on the [ACL Rolling Review website](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).
The submitting author must have an OpenReview profile. Please ensure profiles are complete before submission. [This tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kJeoAfwbnFapUN0ySLSoOm11-2odz48DGS1DEzNs03k/edit#slide=id.gcfa2063058_0_0) from the ACL Rolling Review might be helpful.


#### Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data
ARR encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. Supplementary materials may include appendices, software or data. For example, pre processing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into appendices. However, if the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in appendices. Reviewers are not required to consider material in appendices.
Appendices should come after the references in the submitted pdf, but do not count towards the page limit. Software should be submitted as a single .tgz or .zip archive, and data as a separate single .tgz or .zip archive. Supplementary materials must be fully anonymized to preserve the two-way anonymized reviewing policy.
