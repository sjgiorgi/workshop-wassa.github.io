## Background and Envisaged Scope

Starting with reviews on products on e-commerce sites and ending with the emotional effect presentin or intended by media coverage, research in automatic Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis as wellas explicit and implicit Emotion Detection and Classification has flourished in the past years.  Theimportance of the field has been proven by the high number of approaches proposed in research in thepast decade, as well as by the interest it generated in other disciplines, such as Economics, Sociology,Psychology, Marketing, Crisis Management  Digital Humanities. Building on previous editions, the aim of WASSA 2022 is to bring together researchers workingon Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications toother NLP or real-world tasks (e.g.  public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, socialmedia mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspectsof affect computation from text.  For this edition,  we encourage the submission of long and shortresearch and demo papers including, but not restricted to the following topics:

- Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies, e.g.  COVID-19
- Resources for subjectivity, sentiment, emotion and social media analysis
- Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, aggregation and summarization
- Humor, Irony and Sarcasm detection
- Mis and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes
- Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis
- Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl.  personality analysis and profiling
- Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis
- Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis
- Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- The role of emotions in argument mining
- Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis
- Multimodal emotion detection and classification
- Applications of sentiment and emotion mining

## Paper Submission

At WASSA 2022, we will accept three types of submissions:
For the regular research track we accept **long** & **short** papers:

- **Long** papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, with any number of additional pages of references, and will be presented orally.
Short papers
- **Short** papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, with two (2) additional pages of references, and will be presented either orally or as a poster.

We accept that you commit your ARR reviews in parallel to WASSA and another venue. Please note that you must immediately withdraw your paper from WASSA if you decide to publish it elsewhere.


Submissions without reviews can be done directly through our [OpenReview website](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Workshop/WASSA).


Authors who received reviews already through the ACL Rolling Review process are invited to commit their reviewed paper to WASSA. To do so, please go to https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Workshop/WASSA on OpenReview and click on "ACL 2022 Workshop WASSA Commitment Submission". You will then need to add the title, the URL to the ARR submission with reviews + metareview, and other information.

For more information about templates, guidelines, and instructions, check the ARR Call for Papers.

New this year is that we also introduce an industry track, for which we accept **demo papers**:

- **Demo papers** describe system demonstrations, ranging from early prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Please note that Please note: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate for this track. Demo papers may consist of up to six (6) pages of content, these will be presented as a poster and should include a live demonstration. For more information <a href="https://www.2022.aclweb.org/calldemos">click here</a>.

Additionally, system description papers from the shared task will be presented either orally or as poster.

## Shared-Task: Empathy Detection and Emotion Classification

Emotion is a concept that is challenging to describe. Yet, as human beings, we understand the emotional effect situations have or could have on us and other people. How can we transfer this knowledge to machines? Is it possible to learn the link between situations and the emotions they trigger in an automatic way?

We propose the Shared Task on Empathy Detection, Emotion Classification and Personnality Detection, organized as part of WASSA 2022 at ACL 2022. This task aims at developing models which can predict empathy and emotion based on essays written in reaction to news articles where there is harm to a person, group, or other.

Important dates:
---------------
- Jan. 3rd: Training data released
- March 13th: Evaluation phase starts
- March 16th: Evaluation phase ends
- March 21st: Deadline for system description (4 pgs)
- April 3rd: Notification of acceptance
- April 10th: Camera-ready due

## Organizers

### Dr. Jeremy Barnes 
Dr. Jeremy Barnes is an assistant professor at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU and a member of the IXA NLP group.  He holds a PhD in computational linguistics from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona on Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis for Under-resourced Languages. His research focuses on creating resources and NLP models for under-resourced languages and scenarios, including cross-lingual methods, weak supervision, multi-task learning, and domain adaptation, and he has worked extensively on sentiment and emotion analysis.

### Prof. dr. Orphée De Clercq
Prof. dr. Orphée De Clercq is assistant professor of language technology for educational applications at the LT3 Language and Translation Technology Team of Ghent University.  She has extensive experience in deep semantic processing of natural language, readability prediction and text mining of (subjective) user-generated content using machine learning techniques.  Regarding the latter she has  explored  new  techniques  for  aspect-based  sentiment  analysis,  ported  this  pipeline  to  different domains and languages and successfully finalized a valorization project with the industry.  Currently, she is also looking into implicit sentiment analysis and emotion detection.  She has published in some of the leading NLP conferences and journals and has co-organised several shared tasks on sentiment analysis in the past.

### Dr.  Valentin  Barriere
Dr.  Valentin  Barriere is  a  PostDoc  researcher  at  the  European  Commission’s  Joint  Research Center of Ispra.  During his PhD, he worked on affective phenomena detection in oral interaction. He mainly worked with graphical discriminative models using features leveraging the robustness and the high accuracy of Machine Learning algorithms with the fine-grained modeling of linguistic rules. He is now working on multilingual sentiment analysis and multimodal content analysis.

### Dr. Shabnam Tafreshi
Dr. Shabnam Tafreshi is an assistant research scientist at University of Maryland, Applied Re-search Lab for Intelligence and Security. Research interests: computational semantic understanding across languages.  She is working towards improving NLP models to better extract knowledge from text by complementing NLP models with meaning constructs. Better models are needed for down-stream tasks in text classification and knowledge extraction.  In addition, her research is focused on methodologies for collecting and annotating quality data for building robust NLP models.

### Dr. Sawsan Alqahtani

Before moving to Stuttgart, he worked at the University of Bielefeld, at the Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Roman Klinger’s vision is to enable computers to understand and generate text regarding both factual and non-factual information.  This finds application in inter-disciplinary research, including biomedical text mining, digital humanities, modelling psychological concepts (like emotions) in language, and social media mining.  He co-organized several workshopsin the past, including two editions of WASSA.

### Dr. Alexandra Balahur
