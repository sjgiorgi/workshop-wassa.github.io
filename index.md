## 14th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social Media Analysis

## News

**Feb 26**: First CFP for WASSA workshop is out. Happy to announce that this year WASSA is also hosting two shared tasks.
**Jan 15**: We have confirmation that WASSA will take place on Thursday 15 August 2024.

### Background and Envisaged Scope
Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis has become a highly developed research area, ranging from binary classification of reviews to the detection of complex emotion structures between entities found in text. This field has expanded both on a practical level, finding numerous successful applications in business, as well as on a theoretical level, allowing researchers to explore more complex research questions related to affective computing. Its continuing importance is also shown by the interest it generates in other disciplines such as Economics, Sociology, Psychology, Marketing, Crisis Management & Digital Humanities.

The aim of WASSA 2024 is to bring together researchers working on Subjectivity, Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Detection and Classification and their applications to other NLP or real-world tasks (e.g. public health messaging, fake news, media impact analysis, social media mining, computational literary studies) and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. For this edition, we encourage the submission of long and short research and demo papers including, but not restricted to the following topics:


- Resources for subjectivity, sentiment, emotion and social media analysis
- Opinion retrieval, extraction, categorization, aggregation and summarization
- Humor, Irony and Sarcasm detection
- Mis- and disinformation analysis and the role of affective attributes
- Aspect and topic-based sentiment and emotion analysis
- Analysis of stable traits of social media users, incl. personality analysis and profiling
- Transfer learning for domain, language and genre portability of sentiment analysis
- Modelling commonsense knowledge for subjectivity, sentiment or emotion analysis
- Improvement of NLP tasks using subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of subjectivity and/or sentiment analysis
- The role of emotions in argument mining
- Application of theories from related fields to subjectivity and sentiment analysis
- Multimodal emotion detection and classification
- Applications of sentiment and emotion mining
- Public sentiments and communication patterns of public health emergencies.

We furthermore encourage submissions to the special theme Ethics in Affective Computing, including opinion papers, as well as experimental papers. This includes the following topics, but is not limited to them:

- Which properties of a model render a automatic analysis task unethical?
- Which characteristics of an annotation task are to be considered in ethical considerations?
- What are appropriate methods to analyze data and models from an ethical perspective?
- What aspects are particular important for affective analysis tasks, in contrast to other NLP
settings?
